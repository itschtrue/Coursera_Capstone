    "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, being locate near the workplace has become less necessary and working remotely has become essential. As a result working remotely has become our new norm and will most likely continue after the pandemic. This becomes an excellent opportunity to bounce between cities from one year to the next and experience a city in depth instead of shallow glimpse a vacation offers. However, choosing a neighborhood to move into without visiting first becomes quite daunting. Using the Foursquare venue api, we could compare cities and evaluate them before moving. "

    "Further refinement of the data can be done to differentiate between the cities of interest. The mapping between the specific venue categories to the generic venue categories can be further refined by adding back in more categories. Another possibility is to increase the number of venues retrieved from the Foursquare api. Also by supplementing the foursquare data with housing information can also help differentiate. This housing information can come from zillow and can be housing availability and cost. Finally, being more specific to areas within cities can help distinguish between cities of interest. \n",

    "In this study, we compared three cities: Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and San Francisco, California to Oakland, California to decide what city would be nice to remotely work from for a given year. This was done by comparing the venue categories of the top 100 venues of each city. The specific venue categories were overly specific that would skew this analysis, a mapping between the specific categories to more generic categories were applied. Because of the breadth of the different venue categories, preferences were also given to further refine the similarity. Through the analysis we observed that Portland, Oregon is the most similar to Oakland, California. "
